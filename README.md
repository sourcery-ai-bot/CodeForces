# CodeForces
Repo with solutions to CodeForces ProblemSets in Python.

Admittedly not all written as I would write other code, not default to PEP8 compliance, generally just trying to achieve fast code (CodeForces has time limitations for solutions) that should be generally easily to discern what is happening.

Currently just a repository for my own reference as I make my way through their practice 'ProblemSets', so current intention to add code commenting.
